# CapstoneProject

This project is an automated price tracker for amazon products. This tracks price at certain times of the day, every 6 hours starting at 1:00am EST. The program scrapes the data from the website and logs it into a .csv file named "price_history.csv", this file is also used to generate 3 seperate graphs using matplotlib in real time.
